<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/dec02.png" width="80" height="31" alt="decoration" title="" />
</div>
<p>The interesting events narrated in this book
which occurred at Hydesville, in the house of the
Fox Family, are those by which Modern Spiritualism
made its advent into this world as a new revelation
in spiritual matters.</p>

<p>History is not without its reliable records of
similar phenomena, but, just as many scientific men
have experimented and stopped short of the gateway
of the actual discovery of Nature's secrets, so, many
who came in contact with phenomena similar to
those of Hydesville whilst being mystified as to
the meaning of the operating power, stopped short
of the actual discovery that "It can see as well as
hear." Notably in the case of the disturbances at
Mr. Mompesson's house at Tedworth (1661&mdash;1663) and
Mr. Wesley's parsonage at Epworth (1716&mdash;1717).</p>

<p>The early literature of the Spiritualist Movement
is replete with most interesting records of phenomena
of bewildering variety, but during the past twenty
years the demand for literature on this absorbing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
subject has taken a more philosophic turn. The
phenomena are admittedly real. The philosophy is
the subject of debate, hence these early records are
fast going out of print and becoming difficult to
obtain.</p>

<p>Some few years ago, when the writer paid what
proved to be his last visit to Mrs. Emma Hardinge
Britten, he was deeply impressed with her desire that
the early history of the Spiritualist Movement, for
which she spent the greater part of her industrious
life, and with which she had been so intimately
connected, should not be allowed to pass into oblivion,
and that at least the story of HYDESVILLE should
be published in a handy form and at a reasonable
price. For this purpose she presented him with what
appeared to be her only remaining copy of her
invaluable historical work "Modern American Spiritualism,"
and requested him to undertake that duty.</p>

<p>The incidents recorded in the following pages
are based chiefly on the information given in the
work mentioned above, and considerable use is made
of the actual words and sentences penned by Mrs.
Britten; these are given without quotation marks.
Some portions however have been re-written to adapt
them to the requirements of the present book, whilst
a few other facts have been gathered from various<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
sources, chiefly Robert Dale Owen's "Footfalls on
the Boundary of Another World." Both Mrs. Britten
and Mr. Owen were personally acquainted with the
Fox family and many of the persons incidentally
mentioned in connection with the phenomena at
HYDESVILLE&mdash;a fact which gives superior weight
to their records.</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p>Having been a sad invalid since June of this
year, and still suffering, I do not quite remember
whether I have or not written to you on the subject
to which I desire to devote this poor scrawl. If I
have not done so hitherto&mdash;permit me to say,&mdash;altho'
I have been obliged from severe illness to suspend
my platform work and writings, I am as much interested
in the earnest desire to help the progress of
Spiritualism as I have been in my long years of past
devotion to that cause.</p>

<p>In consequence of my sad illness I have been
obliged to refuse my kind American Friends' urgent
invitation to attend their Grand Celebration at
Rochester, N.Y., next June.</p>

<div class='center'><b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</b></div>


<p>I am most anxious to do something for our noble
cause, [enquirers] will necessarily want to have some
special accounts of the first opening of the Spiritual
Movement and the history of the poor Fox Family
and their immediate connection with the famous
"Rochester Knockings." All this I, who knew the
Fox Family and all the circumstances of the case<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
personally and intimately, have written and published
in full detail in my widely circulated work "Modern
American Spiritualism."&mdash;But this work consists of
560 pages, and tho' bought by thousands of American
Spiritualists, I should not know in England where
to turn to find a copy except in my own bookcase.</p>

<p>Now what I propose is this: In the first hundred
pages is the full and entire history of the movement;
the life and labours of A. J. Davis,&mdash;the life, sufferings,
and bitter persecutions of the poor Foxes, and all
their early trials; friends, foes, and all connected
with them. Why cannot you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. take those
hundred pages, condense them, and make a splendid
pamphlet of them?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>


<p>The birth-places of the greatest of the world's
social, political, and religious reformations have
generally been of insignificant and lowly aspect, and
apparently under the most inauspicious circumstances
for producing any great effect upon mankind. The
Babe of the lowly manger becomes the Spiritual
King of millions of human hearts and souls, and the
"Wood Hut" becomes the gateway through which
Holy Ministers of Light, from their world of Truth
and Beauty, send the evidence of man's immortality,
through the instrumentality of a child, to the weary
worn pilgrims of earth, who, praying for the "touch
of a vanish'd hand, and the sound of a voice that is
still," welcome with joyful hearts the Spirit message
"WE STILL LIVE."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>The scene of the manifestations dealt with in the
following pages, was a small wooden homestead, one
of a cluster of houses like itself, in the little village
of Hydesville, near to the town of Newark, Wayne
County, New York (being so called after Dr. Hyde,
an old settler, whose son was the proprietor of the
house in question). The place not being directly
accessible from a railroad, was lonely and unmarked
by those tokens of progress that the locomotive
generally leaves in its track, hence it was the last
spot where a scene of fraud and deception could find
a possibility of a successful execution. The house
was a humble frame dwelling fronting south, consisting
of two fair-size parlours opening into each
other, east of these a bedroom and a buttery or
pantry, opening into one of the sitting rooms; and
a stairway between the buttery and the bedroom
leading from the sitting room up to the half storey
above and from the buttery down to the cellar.</p>

<p>This humble dwelling had been selected as a
temporary residence during the erection of another
house in the country, by Mr. John D. Fox, who, with
his family, soon afterwards became so prominently
identified with the phenomena which have since become
world famous. Their little dwelling, though
so small and simply furnished as to leave no shadow
of opportunity for concealment or trick, was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
residence of honest piety and rural simplicity. All
who ever knew them bore witness to the unimpeachable
character of the good mother, while the integrity
of the simple-minded farmers who were father and
brother to the sisters who have since become so
celebrated as the "Rochester Knockers" stands proved
beyond all question.</p>

<p>The ancestors of Mr. Fox were Germans, the
name being originally "Voss"; but both he and Mrs.
Fox were native born. In Mrs. Fox's family, French
by origin and Rutan by name, several individuals
had evinced the power of second sight,&mdash;her maternal
grandmother (Margaret Ackerman) who resided at
Long Island, had frequent perceptions of coming
events; so vivid were these presentiments that she
frequently followed phantom funerals to the grave
as if they were real.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fox's sister also, Mrs. Elizabeth Higgins, had
similar power. On one occasion, in the year 1823,
the two sisters, then residing in New York, proposed
to go to Sodus by canal. But one morning Elizabeth
said, "We shall not make this trip by water." "Why
so?" her sister asked. "Because I dreamed last night
that we travelled by land, and there was a strange
person with us. In my dream, too, I thought we
came to Mott's tavern on the Beech Woods, and that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
they could not admit us because Mrs. Mott lay
dying in the house. I know it will all come true."
"Very likely indeed!" her sister replied, "for last
year, when we passed there, Mr. Mott's wife lay dead
in the house." "You will see. He must have
married again and he will lose his second wife."
Every particular came to pass as Mrs. Higgins had
predicted. Mrs. Johnson, a stranger, whom at the
time of the dream they had not seen, did go with
them, they made the journey by land and were
refused admittance into Mott's tavern for the very
cause assigned in the dream.</p>

<p>The family of Mr. and Mrs. Fox consisted of six
children, but at the time of the manifestations the
house was occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Fox and their
two youngest children only, Margaretta, aged twelve,
and Kate, aged nine years. These details, insignificant
as they may now appear, are due alike to the
family and posterity. When the future of this wonderful
movement shall have become matter of history
and antiquity, if not reverence for spiritual truth,
and shall induce mankind to follow the example of
their ancestors and label the records "sacred," the
names now sunk in obscurity and masked by slander
may perchance be engraved in monuments of bronze
and marble, and the incidents now deemed too slight
for notice become reverenced as "Holy Writ."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
These changes of chance and time have happened
before; if history repeats itself they will occur again.
It was reserved to this family to be the instruments
of communicating to the world this most singular
affair. They were the ones who first, as if by accident,
found out that there was an INTELLIGENCE
MANIFESTED EVEN IN THE RAPPING, which
at first appeared nothing more than an annoying and
unaccountable noise.</p>

<p>In a publication of the early investigations connected
with this house, entitled: "A Report of the
Mysterious Noises heard in the house of Mr. John D.
Fox, in Hydesville, Arcadia, Wayne County, authenticated
by the certificates and confirmed by the
statements of the citizens of that place and vicinity,"
we find that some disturbances had affected the
house before the Fox family came to live there. In
the year 1843-4, the farm was occupied by a Mr. and
Mrs. Bell, who, during the last three months of their
stay were joined by a young girl&mdash;Lucretia Pulver,
who sometimes worked for them, and at other times
boarded with them and went to school, she being
about fifteen years old.</p>

<p>According to the statement of Lucretia, called
forth by subsequent investigations, a pedlar called at
the house one afternoon whom Mrs. Bell seemed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
recognise as an acquaintance. He was a man about
thirty years of age, dressed in a black frock coat,
light trousers and vest, and carried with him a pack
of goods containing dress material and other draperies.</p>

<p>Shortly after the arrival of the pedlar, Mrs. Bell
called the girl to say that she could not afford to
keep her any longer, and that as she was going to
the next village the same afternoon, she might pack
her clothes and they would go together. Before
going, Lucretia chose from the pedlar's pack a piece
of delaine, asking him to leave it at her father's
house; this he promised to do the next day. Mrs.
Bell and Lucretia then left the house, the pedlar and
Mr. Bell remained behind, the former apparently
having decided to stay there for the day. The pedlar
did not call at Lucretia's father's house next day in
fulfilment of his promise to do so, nor, in fact, was
he ever seen again, a circumstance which should be
borne in mind when the sequel to this story is under
consideration.</p>

<p>About three days afterwards, much to the girl's
surprise, Mrs. Bell sent for Lucretia to return to her
again. She did so, and from that time she began to
hear noises and knockings in her bedroom, the same
room which was afterwards occupied by Mr. and
Mrs. Fox. On one occasion, when Mr. and Mrs. Bell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
were away from home at Lock Berlin, and Lucretia
had to remain in the house, she sent for her young
brother and a girl friend named Aurelia Losey to
stay in the house with her. During the night they
all heard noises which they declared sounded like
the footsteps of a man passing from the bedroom to
the buttery, then down the cellar stairs, traversing
the cellar for a short time and then suddenly stopping.
They were all very much frightened and got up to
fasten the doors and windows, but were scarcely able
to sleep the remainder of the night.</p>

<p>About a week after the visit of the pedlar to the
house, Lucretia having occasion to go down into the
cellar, stumbled and fell into a hole filled with soft
soil, this somewhat frightened her and caused her to
scream for assistance. Mrs. Bell coming to her
rescue, Lucretia asked what Mr. Bell had been doing
in the cellar that it was all "dug up." Mrs. Bell
replied that "the holes were only rat holes," and a
few nights afterwards Lucretia observed that Mr.
Bell was busy for some time in the cellar filling up
the "rat holes" with earth which he carried there
himself.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the period in which the
house was occupied by the Bell family, the sounds
continued to be heard, not only by Lucretia but by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Mrs. Bell. Lucretia's mother, Mrs. Pulver, was a
frequent visitor at the house, and on one occasion
in particular, after the foregoing events, when she
called upon Mrs. Bell, she found the latter quite ill
from want of rest, and on enquiring the cause, Mrs.
Bell declared she was "sick of her life," and that
she frequently "heard the footsteps of a man traversing
the house all night."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>


<p>A few months after these events happened the
Bells left the neighbourhood, and the house became
tenanted by a Mr. and Mrs. Weekman, who lived
there about eighteen months, and left in the year
1847. Mr. Weekman's statement respecting the noises
he heard was to the effect that one evening when he
was about to retire for the night, he heard a rapping
on the outside door, and, what was rather unusual
for him, instead of familiarly bidding them "come
in," stepped to the door and opened it. He had no
doubt of finding some one who wished to come in,
but to his surprise found no one there. He stepped
out and looked around, supposing that some person
was imposing on him, he could discover no one, and
went back into the house. After a short time he
heard the rapping again, and stepped up and held
on to the latch, so that he might ascertain if any one
had taken that means to annoy him. The rapping
was repeated, the door opened instantly, but no one
was in sight. Mr. Weekman states that he could
feel the jar of the door very plainly when the rapping
was heard. As he opened the door he sprang out
and went around the house, but no one was in sight,
nor could he find trace of any intruder.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>They were frequently afterwards disturbed by
strange and unaccountable noises. One night Mrs.
Weekman heard what she deemed to be the footsteps
of someone walking in the cellar. Another night Mr.
Weekman and his wife were disturbed by hearing a
scream from their child, a girl about eight years of
age,&mdash;this happened at midnight,&mdash;they went to her
and she told them that something like a hand passed
over her face and head; it seemed cold, and so
badly had she been frightened that it was some time
before she could be induced to tell her parents the
cause of her alarm, nor would she consent to sleep
in the same room for several nights afterwards.</p>

<p>All this might have happened, and been only the
idle fabric of a child's dream, the Weekman family
might have imagined what they gave out as fact,
and we should be inclined to believe that such was
the case, if we had not the most conclusive evidence
that such manifestations were quite common, not
only in this house, but in various others where
similarly strange things have happened.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class='poem'>
"Know well my soul, God's hand controls<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Whate'er thou fearest."</span><br />
</div>


<p>From the time the Fox family entered the house
at Hydesville, about December, 1847, they were incessantly
disturbed by similar noises to those heard
by Lucretia Pulver and the Weekmans. During the
next month however (January, 1848) the noises began
to assume the character of slight knockings heard at
night in the bedroom; sometimes appearing to sound
from the cellar beneath. At first Mrs. Fox sought
to persuade herself this might be the hammering of
a shoemaker in a house hard by, sitting up late at
work. But further observation showed that the
sounds originated in the house. For not only did
the knockings become more distinct, and not only
were they heard first in one part of the house, then
in another, but the family remarked that these raps,
even when not very loud, often caused a motion,
tremulous rather than a sudden jar, of the bedsteads
and chairs&mdash;sometimes of the floor; a motion which
was quite perceptible to the touch when a hand was
laid on the chairs, which was sometimes sensibly
felt at night in the slightly oscillating motion of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
bed, and which was occasionally perceived as a sort
of vibration even when standing on the floor. After
a time also, the noises varied in their character,
sounding occasionally like distinct footfalls in the
different rooms.</p>

<p>In the month of February, the noises became so
distinct and continuous that their rest was broken
night after night, and they were all becoming worn
out in their efforts to discover the cause of the
annoyances. These disturbances were not confined
to sounds merely,&mdash;once something heavy, as if a dog,
seemed to lie on the feet of the children; but it was
gone before the mother could come to their aid.
Another time (this was late in March) Kate felt as if
a cold hand was on her face. Occasionally too, the
bedclothes were pulled during the night. Finally
chairs were moved from their places. The disturbances,
which had been limited to occasional knockings
throughout February and March, gradually increased
towards the close of the latter month, both in loudness
and frequency. Mr. Fox and his wife got up
night after night, lit a candle, and thoroughly searched
every nook and corner of the house; but without
any result. They discovered nothing. When the
raps came on a door, Mr. Fox would stand, ready to
open the door the instant the raps were repeated.
Though he opened the door immediately there was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
no one to be seen. Nor did he or Mrs. Fox obtain
any clue as to the cause of the trouble, notwithstanding
all the efforts they made and the precautions
they exercised.</p>

<p>The only circumstance which seemed to suggest
the possibility of trickery or of mistake was, that
these various unexplained occurrences never happened
in daylight, and thus notwithstanding the strangeness
of the thing, when morning came they began to think
it must have been the fancy of the night. Not being
given to superstition, they clung, throughout several
weeks of annoyance, to the idea that some natural
explanation of these seemingly mysterious events
would at last appear, nor did they abandon this hope
till the night of</p>

<div class='center'>
FRIDAY, MARCH 31st, 1848,<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>a date which was destined to be indelibly imprinted
on the minds of the coming generations as the daybreak
of a new era in the spiritual development of
humanity, a date which has since been regularly
observed as marking the advent of the greatest
spiritual revelation of modern times, and recognised
as the anniversary of the Spiritualist movement in
all parts of the world.</div>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<p>The day had been cold and stormy, with snow
on the ground. In the course of the afternoon, David,
a son of Mr. and Mrs. Fox, came to visit his parents
from his farm about three miles distant. Mrs. Fox
then first recounted to him the particulars of the
annoyances they had endured; for until now they
had been little disposed to communicate these to any
one. He listened to her with a smiling face. "Well
mother," he said, "I advise you not to say a word
about it to the neighbours. When you find it out it
will be one of the simplest things in the world."
And in that belief he returned to his own home.</p>

<p>Wearied out by a succession of sleepless nights
and of fruitless attempts to penetrate the mystery,
the Fox family retired on that Friday evening very
early to rest, hoping for a respite from the disturbances
that <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'harrased'">harassed</ins> them. But they were doomed to
disappointment. The parents had had the children's
beds removed into their own bedroom, and strictly
enjoined them not to talk of the noises even if they
heard them. But scarcely had the mother seen them
safely in bed, and was retiring to rest herself, when
the children cried out "Here they are again." The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
mother chid them and lay down, but as though in
rebuke of her apparent indifference, they were on this
occasion louder and more pertinacious than ever.
Rest was impossible. The children kept up a continuous
chatter, sitting up in bed to listen to the
sounds. Mr. Fox tried the windows and doors, to
discover, if possible, the source of the annoyance.
The night being windy it suggested itself to him that
it might be the sashes rattling, but all in vain; the
raps continued and were evidently answering the
noise occasioned by the father shaking the windows,
as if in mockery.</p>

<p>At length the youngest child, Kate&mdash;who in her
guileless innocence had become familiar with the
invisible knocker, until she was more amused than
alarmed at its presence&mdash;merrily exclaimed: "Here,
Mr. Split-foot, do as I do." The effect was instantaneous:
the invisible rapper responded by imitating
the number of her movements. She then made a
given number of motions with her finger and thumb
in the air, but without noise, and her astonishment
was re-doubled to find that these movements were
seen by the invisible rapper, for a corresponding
number of knocks were immediately given to her
noiseless motions, whilst from her lips as though but
in childish jest and transport at her new discovery
there sprang to life the words which revealed the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
sublimest Spiritual Truth of modern times: "Only
look mother</p>

<div class='center'>
IT CAN SEE AS WELL AS HEAR."<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>Words which have since become a text which Doctors,
Professors, sceptics and scoffers have tried to crush
out of existence&mdash;and ignominously failed, but which
on the other hand have brought comfort, solace, and
permanent joy to the hearts of hundreds of thousands&mdash;nay,
millions surely,&mdash;of earth's weary pilgrims.
Words which declared a truth since tested by every
possible subtlety and sophistry which the ingenuity
of man could suggest or devise, but which has stood
firmly through every ordeal. Words which declare
a truth that has already become the firm foundation
of faith for an ever progressive Spiritual Church,
made up of almost every nation of the earth, and
embracing adherents from every rank of philosophic,
scientific, religious and social life, which, moreover,
reveals its own attributes to the child and the philosopher
alike, and provides the missing link between
a finite material world and a world of infinite
spiritual possibilities by proving the continuity of life.</div>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>


<p>Happily for the momentous work which the
spiritual telegraphers had undertaken to initiate in
this humble dwelling, the first manifestations did not
appeal to the high and learned of the earth, but to
the plain common-sense of an honest farmer's wife,
and suggested that whatever could see, hear, and
intelligently respond to relevant queries, must have
in it something in common with humanity; and thus
Mrs. Fox continued her investigations. Addressing
the viewless rapper she said "count ten;" the raps
obeyed. "How old is my daughter Margaret?" then
"Kate?" Both questions were distinctly and correctly
rapped out. Mrs. Fox then asked "How many children
have I?" Seven, was the reply; this however
proved to be wrong for she had only six living. She
repeated her question and was again answered by
seven raps; suddenly she cried "How many have I
living?" Six raps responded. "How many dead?"
a single knock; and both these answers proved
correct. To the next question, "Are you a man
that knocks?" there was no response; but "Are you
a spirit?" elicited firm and distinctive responsive
knocks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Emboldened by her success, Mrs. Fox continued
her enquiries and ascertained by raps that the messages
were coming from what purported to be the Spirit of
an injured man who had been murdered for his money.
To the question how old he was, there came thirty-one
distinct raps. He also gave them to understand
that he was a married man, and had left a wife and
five children; that his wife was dead, and had been
dead two years. After ascertaining so much, she
asked the question "Will the noise continue if I call
in some neighbours?" The answer was by rapping
in the affirmative.</p>

<p>At first they called in their nearest neighbours,
who came thinking they would have a hearty laugh
at the family for being frightened&mdash;but when the first
neighbour came in and found that the noise, whatever
it might be, could tell the age of herself as well
as others, and give correct answers to questions on
matters of which the family of Mr. Fox was quite
ignorant, she concluded that there was something
beside a subject of ridicule and laughter in these
unseen but audible communications. These neighbours
insisted on calling others who came, and after
investigation were as much confounded as at first.</p>

<p>The reader must endeavour to picture to himself
the scene which followed the introduction of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
neighbours to this weird and most novel court of
inquiry. Imagine the place to be an humble cottage
in a remote and obscure hamlet; the judge and
jurors, simple unsophisticated rustics; and the witness
an invisible, unknown being, a denizen of a world
of whose very existence mankind has been ignorant;
acting by laws mysterious and inconceivable, in
modes utterly beyond all human control or comprehension,
and breaking through what has been deemed
the dark and eternal seal of death, to reveal the
long-hidden mysteries of the grave, and drag to the
light secrets which not even the fabled silence of the
grave could longer hide away. Those who have
been accustomed to dream of death as the end of
all whom its shadowy portals inclose, alone are
prepared to appreciate the awful and startling reality
of this strange scene, breaking apart, as it did, like
a rope of sand, all the preconceived opinions of
countless ages on the existence and destiny of the
living dead.</p>

<p>Those who have become familiar with the revealments
of the spirit circle will only smile at the
consternation evoked in this rustic party by the now
familiar presence and manifestations of "the spirits,"
but to those who still stand in the night of superstition,
deeming of all earth's countless millions as
"dead," "lost," "gone," no one knows whither; never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
to return; to give no sign, no echo, no dim vibration
from that vast gulf profound of unfathomed mystery&mdash;what
a picture is that which suddenly brings them
face to face with the mighty hosts of the vanished
dead, all clothed in life, and girded round with a
panoply of power, and light, and strength; with
vivid memory of the secret wrongs deemed buried in
their graves. Our cities are thronged with an unseen
people who flit about us, their piercing eyes
invisible to us, are scanning all our ways. The universe
is teeming with them,&mdash;"THERE ARE NO DEAD,"&mdash;the
air, the earth, and the sky above, are filled with
a viewless host of spirit&mdash;witnesses whose messages
ever declare "There is no death."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>


<p>Amongst the investigators introduced to the
household was a Mr. William Deusler, of Arcadia,
an immediate neighbour of the Fox family at this
time, and from his testimony we gather a great
many interesting facts as to the evidence offered by
the injured spirit in order that its identity could be
clearly established.</p>

<p>Mr. Deusler had formerly lived with his father
in this house, and the message that the spirit had
received an injury, prompted him to ask if either he
or his father had been the cause of such an injury.
On receiving an assurance that they were in no way
responsible, the investigation was continued, the
results being here given in Mr. Deusler's own words&mdash;</p>

<p>"I then asked if Mr. &mdash;&mdash; [naming a person who
had formerly lived in the house] had injured it, and
if so, to manifest it by rapping, and it made three
knocks louder than common, and at the same time
the bedstead jarred more than it had done before.
I then inquired if it was murdered for money, and
the knocking was heard. I then requested it to rap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
when I mentioned the sum of money for which it
was murdered. I then asked if it was one hundred,
two, three or four, and when I came to five hundred
the rapping was heard. All in the room said they
heard it distinctly. I then asked the question if it
was five hundred dollars, and the rapping was heard.</p>

<p>"After this, I sent over and got Artemus W. Hyde
to come over.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> He came over. I then asked over
nearly the same questions as before, and got the
same answers. Mr. Redfield sent after David Jewel
and wife, and Mrs. Hyde also came. After they
came in I asked the same questions over and got the
same answers.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I then asked it to rap my
age&mdash;the number of years of my age. It rapped
thirty times. This is my age, and I do not think
any one about here knew my age, except myself and
family. I then told it to rap my wife's age, and it
rapped thirty times, which is her exact age; several
of us counted it at the same time. I then asked it
to rap A. W. Hyde's age; then Mrs. A. W. Hyde's
age. I then continued to ask it to rap the ages of
different persons&mdash;naming them&mdash;in the room, and it
did so correctly, as they all said. I then asked the
number of children in the different families in the
neighbourhood, and it told them correctly in the
usual way, by rapping; also the number of deaths<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
that had taken place in the different families, and it
told correctly.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"I then asked in regard to the time it was
murdered, and in the usual way, by asking the
different days of the week and the different hours of
the day, learned that it was murdered on Tuesday
night, about twelve o'clock. The rapping was heard
only when this particular time was mentioned. When
it was asked if it was murdered on a Wednesday, or
Thursday, or Friday night, etc., there was no rapping.
I then asked if it carried any trunk, and it rapped
that it did. Then how many, and it rapped once.
In the same way we ascertained that it had goods in
the trunk, and that &mdash;&mdash; took them when he murdered
him; and that he had a pack of goods besides.
I asked if its wife was living, and it did not rap.
If she was dead, and it rapped.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This was
tried over several times and the result was always
the same.</p>

<p>"I then tried to ascertain the first letters of its
name by calling over the different letters of the
alphabet. I commenced with A, and asked if it was
the initial of its name; and when I asked if it was
B the rapping commenced. We then tried all the
other letters, but could get no answer by the usual
rapping. I then asked if we could find out the whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
name by reading over all the letters of the alphabet,
and there was no rapping. I then reversed the
question, and the rapping was heard.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
There were a good many more questions asked on
that night by myself and others which I do not now
remember. They were all readily answered in the
same way. I staid in the house until about twelve
o'clock and then came home. Mr. Redfield and Mr.
Fox staid in the house that night.</p>

<p>"Saturday night I went over again about seven
o'clock. The house was full of people when I got
there. They said it had been rapping some time.
I went into the room. It was rapping in answer to
questions when I went in.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"There were as many as three hundred people in
and around the house at this time, I should think.
Hiram Soverhill, Esq., and Volney Brown asked it
questions while I was there, and it rapped in answer
to them.</p>

<p>"I went over again on Sunday between one and
two o'clock p.m. I went into the cellar with several
others, and had them all leave the house over our
heads; and then I asked, if there had been a man
buried in the cellar, to manifest it by rapping or any
other noise or sign. The moment I asked the question<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
there was a sound like the falling of a stick about a
foot long and half an inch through, on the floor in
the bedroom over our heads. It did not seem to
rebound at all; there was but one sound. I then
asked Stephen Smith to go right up and examine the
room, and see if he could discover the cause of the
noise. He came back and said he could discover
nothing; that there was no one in the room, or in
that part of the house. I then asked two more
questions, and it rapped in the usual way. We all
went up-stairs and made a thorough search, but
could find nothing.</p>

<p>"I then got a knife and fork, and tried to see if
I could make the same noise by dropping them, but
I could not. This was all I heard on Sunday. There
is only one floor, or partition, or thickness between
the bedroom and the cellar; no place where anything
could be secreted to make the noise. When this
noise was heard in the bedroom I could feel a slight
tremulous motion or jar.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"On Monday night I heard this noise again, and
asked the same questions I did before and got the
same answers. This is the last time I have heard any
rapping. I can in no way account for this singular
noise which I and others have heard. It is a mystery
to me which I am unable to solve.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"I lived in the same house about seven years ago,
and at that time never heard any noises of the kind
in and about the premises. I have understood from
Johnston and others who have lived there before &mdash;&mdash;
moved there, that there were no such sounds heard
there while they occupied the house. I never believed
in haunted houses, or heard or saw anything but
what I could account for before.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>


<p>The news of the mysterious rappings continued
to spread abroad, and the house was filled with
anxious seekers for the unknown and invisible visitor.
Up to this time the noises had only been heard at
night, but on Sunday morning, April 2nd, the sounds
were first heard in the daytime, and by any who
could get into the house. It has been estimated that
at one time there were about five hundred people
gathered around the house, so great was the excitement
at the commencement of these strange occurrences.</p>

<p>On the Monday following, Mr. Fox and others
commenced digging in the cellar, but as the house
was built on low ground and in the vicinity of a
stream then much swollen by rains, it was not
surprising that they were baffled by the influx of
water at the distance of three feet down. In the
summer of 1848, when the ground was dry and the
water lowered, the digging again commenced, when
they found a plank, a vacant place or hole, some bits
of crockery, which seemed to have been a washbowl,
traces of charcoal, quicklime, some human hair,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
bones (declared on examination by a surgeon to be
human), including a portion of a skull, but no connected
skull was found.</p>

<p>[Interesting facts relating to the missing portions
of the human body were announced in the public
newspapers as recently as December, 1904, for which
see <a href="#Page_59">Appendix</a>.]</p>

<p>Such were the results of the examination of the
cellar; such the only corroborative evidences obtained
of the truth of the spirit's tale of untimely death.
The presence of human remains in the cellar proves
that someone was buried there, and the quicklime
and charcoal testify to the fact that attempts were
made to secretly dispose of the body of the victim.</p>

<p>The Fox family did not immediately quit the
scene of this mysterious haunting, but remained to
witness still more astounding phenomena. The furniture
was frequently moved about; the girls were
often touched by hard cold hands; doors were
opened and shut with violence; their beds were so
violently shaken that they were obliged to "camp
out" as they termed it, on the ground; their bedclothes
were dragged from them, and the very floor
and house made to rock as in an earthquake. Night
after night they would be appalled by hearing a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
sound like a death struggle, the gurgling of the
throat, a sudden thud as of something falling, the
dragging as of a helpless body across the room and
down the cellar stairs, the digging of a grave, nailing
of boards, and the filling up as of a new made grave.
These sounds have subsequently been produced by
request, and spontaneously also, in the presence of
many persons assembled in circles at Rochester.</p>

<p>It was perceived that "the spirits" seemed to
select or require the presence of the two younger
girls of the family for the production of the sounds,
and though these had been made without them,
especially on the night of the 31st of March, when
all the members of the family save Mr. Fox were
absent from the house, still as curiosity prompted
them to close observation and conversation with the
invisible power, it was clear that the manifestations
became more powerful in the presence of Kate, the
youngest daughter, than with any one else.</p>

<p>As the house was continually thronged with
curious inquirers, and the time, comfort and peace of
the family were consumed with these harassing disturbances,
besides the most absurd though injurious
suspicions being cast upon them, they endeavoured
to baffle the haunters by sending Kate to reside with
her eldest sister, Mrs. Fish, at Rochester; but no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
sooner had she gone than the manifestations re-commenced
with more force than ever, in the presence
of Margaretta. In course of time Mrs. Fox, with both
her daughters, went to live in Rochester, but neither
change of place nor house, nor yet the separation of
the family, afforded them any relief from the disturbances
that evidently attached themselves to persons
rather than places as formerly.</p>

<p>Although the Fox family had for months striven
to banish the power that tormented them, praying
with all the fervour of true Methodism to be released
from it, and enduring fear, loss and anxiety in its
continuance, the report of its persistence began to
spread abroad, causing a rain of persecutions to fall
upon them from all quarters. Old friends looked
coldly on them, and strangers circulated the most
atrocious slanders at their expense.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fish, the eldest sister, who was a teacher of
music in Rochester, began to lose her pupils, and
whilst the blanching of the poor mother's hair in a
single week bore testimony to the mental tortures
which supra-mundane terrors and mundane cruelties
had heaped upon them, the world was taunting them
with imposture and with originating the very manifestations
which were destroying their health, peace
of mind, and good name. They had solicited the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
advice of their much-respected friend, Isaac Post, a
highly esteemed Quaker citizen of Rochester, and at
his suggestion succeeded in communicating by raps
with the invisible power, through the alphabet (an
attempt had been previously made but without success).
Telegraphic numbers were given to signify "Yes" or
"No," "Doubtful," etc., and sentences were spelled
out by which they learned the astounding facts that
not only "Charles Rosna" the murdered pedlar, but
hosts of spirits, good and bad, high and low, could
under certain conditions not understood, and impossible
for mortals yet to comprehend, communicate
with earth; that such communication was produced
through the forces of spiritual magnetism, in chemical
affinity; that the varieties of magnetism in different
individuals afforded "medium power" to some, and
denied it to others; that the magnetic relations
necessary to produce phenomena were very subtle,
liable to disturbance and singularly susceptible to the
influence of the mental emotions. In addition to
communications purporting thus to explain the object
and something of the modus operandi of the communion,
numerous spirit friends of the family, and
also of those who joined in their investigations,
gladdened the hearts of their astonished relatives by
direct and unlooked-for tests of their presence. They
came spelling out their names, ages and various
tokens of identity correctly, and proclaiming the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
joyful tidings that they all "still lived," "still loved,"
and with the tenderness of human affection and the
wisdom of a higher sphere of existence, watched
over and guided the beloved ones who had mourned
them as dead, with all the gracious ministry of
guardian angels.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>


<p>But redolent of joy and consolation as is the
intercourse with beloved friends, at this time when
orderly communion has succeeded doubtful experiment,
it must not be supposed that any such
harmonious results characterised the initiatory proceedings
of the spiritual movement which now made
its advent in Rochester.</p>

<p>Within and without the dwellings of the medium,
all was fear, consternation, doubt, and anxiety.
Fanatical religionists of different sects had forced
themselves into the family gatherings, and the wildest
scenes of rant, cant, and absurdity often ensued.
Opinions of the most astounding nature were hazarded
concerning the object of this movement; some
determining that it was a "millennium" and looking
for the speedy reign of a personal Messiah and the
equally speedy destruction of the wicked.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that the clergy were
idle spectators of the tumultuous wave that was
sweeping over the city. On the contrary, several of
them called on Mrs. Fox with offers to "exorcise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the spirits," and when they found their attempts
futile, and that though the spirits would rap in
chorus to the "amens" with which they concluded
their incantations, they were otherwise unmoved by
these reverend performances, they generally ended by
proclaiming abroad that the family were "in league
with the evil one," or the "authors of a vile imposture."</p>

<p>Honourable exceptions, however, were found to
this cowardly and unchristian course, and amongst
these was the Rev. A. H. Jervis, a Methodist minister
of Rochester, in whose family remarkable manifestations
occurred of the same character as in that of the
Foxes, and whose appreciation of the beauty and
worth of the communications he received, several of
his published letters bear witness of. Mr. Lyman
Granger, Rev. Charles Hammond, Deacon Hale, and
several other families of wealth and influence, both
in Rochester and the surrounding towns, also began
to experience similar phenomena in their own households,
while the news came from all quarters,
extending as far as Cincinnati and St. Louis, West,
and Maine, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and New
York, East, that the mysterious rappings and other
phases of what is now called "medium power" were
rapidly spreading from town to town and State to
State, in fulfilment of an assurance made in the very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
first of the communications to the Fox family, namely,
"that these manifestations were not to be confined
to them, BUT WOULD GO ALL OVER THE
WORLD."</p>

<p>The remarkable manner in which this prophecy
has been fulfilled the most casual observer will readily
admit; for Spiritualism&mdash;even as a religious power&mdash;has
far outstripped any other form of religion in the
world in the rapidity of its growth, having reached
every civilized nation and permeated every other
form of belief in less than half a century.</p>

<p>The Fox Sisters were still called the "Rochester
Knockers," the "Fox Girls," the "Rappers," and
other epithets, equally foolish and obnoxious to their
interests and feelings. Catherine Fox, the youngest
girl, had been removed to the house of Mr. W. E.
Capron, of Auburn. Mrs. Fish, though generally
present when phenomena were transpiring, was not
in its earliest phases conscious of being a medium.
Margaretta, the other sister, was then in reality the
only one through whom the manifestations appeared
to proceed, when in November, 1848, the spirits, who
had long been urging them to permit public investigations
to be made through her mediumship, informed
them by raps that "they could not always strive with
them," and since they were constantly disobedient to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the spirits' requests, and obviously opposed to their
presence, they should leave them, and in all probability
withdraw for another generation, or seek
through other sources for the fulfilment of the high
and holy purposes for which this spiritual outpouring
had been designed. To these appeals the family
were inflexible. They constantly prayed that the
cup of this great bitterness "might pass from them."
They did not wish to be "mediums," and abhorred
the notoriety, scandal, and persecution which their
fatal gift had brought them, and when warned that
the spirits would leave them, they protested their
delight at the announcement, and expressed their
earnest desire that it might be fulfilled.</p>

<p>There were present at a circle, when communications
of this character were made, several influential
persons of the city, who had become greatly interested
in the manifestations and were warm friends of the
family. They could not, however, realise that the
threat here implied would actually be fulfilled until
the spirits, by rappings, spelled out several messages
of a particularly affectionate and valedictory character.
The scene became, says an eye-witness, solemn and
impressive. The spirits announced that in twenty
minutes they would depart, and exactly as that time
expired they spelled out, "We will now bid you all
farewell;" when the raps entirely ceased.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>The family expressed themselves "glad to get rid
of them;" the friends present vainly tried to obtain,
by solicitations, made, as it would seem, to empty
air, some demonstration that this beneficent and
wonderful visitation had not indeed wholly ceased.
All was useless. A mournful silence filled the
apartment which had but a few minutes before been
tenanted with angels, sounding out their messages of
undying affection, tender counsel, wise instruction,
and prescient warning. The spirits indeed were gone;
and as one by one the depressed party separated and
passed out into the silent moonlit streets of Rochester,
all and each of them felt as if some great light had
suddenly gone out, and life was changed to them.
There was a mighty blank in space and a shadow
everywhere, but spirit light came no more to illuminate
the thick darkness.</p>

<p>A fortnight passed away, during which the former
investigators called constantly on the Fox family to
enquire if their spirit friends had returned. For the
first few days a stoical negative was their only reply;
after this, they began more and more fully to recognise
the loss they had sustained. The wise counsellors
were gone; the sources of strange strength and
superhuman consolation were cut off. The tender,
loving, wonderful presence no more flitted around
their steps, cheered their meals, encouraged them in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
their human weakness, or guided them in their blindness.
And these most wonderful and providential
beings their own waywardness had driven from them.
At last, then, they met their enquiring friends with
showers of tears, choking sobs, and expressions of the
bitterest self-reproach and regret.</p>

<p>On the twelfth day of this great heart-dearth,
Mr. W. E. Capron, being in Rochester on business,
called at the house of Mrs. Fish, with Mr. George
Willets, a member of the Society of Friends, and one
of their earliest spiritual investigators. On receiving
the usual sorrowful reply that "the spirits had left
them," Mr. Capron said: "Perhaps they will rap for
us if not for you." They then entered the hall and
put the usual question if the spirits would rap for
them, in answer to which, and to the unspeakable
delight of all present, they were greeted with a
perfect shower of the much-lamented sounds.</p>

<p>Once more the spirits urged them to make the
manifestations public. Again they reiterated the
charge with solemn earnestness, and despite of the
mediums' continued aversion to the task imposed
upon them, the fear of a fresh and final bereavement
of the inestimable boon of spirit communion
prevented their continued resistance to the course
proposed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>When the persons who were called upon to aid
the mediums and take somewhat prominent parts in
the work urged the awkwardness of the positions
assigned them, the spirits only replied, "Your triumph
will be so much the greater." There is no doubt
that the severe warning they had just received, and
the fear of its repetition, acted upon the whole party
with more force than any argument that could have
been used to induce their submission.</p>

<p>At the injunctions of the spirits a public investigation
into the possibility of communion between
the world of spirits and the earth they once inhabited
was carried out. Magistrates, editors, and professional
men were the judges, and enlightened American
citizens the jury. The aim of wide-spread publicity
was attained. Thousands heard and wondered at,
and finally believed in spiritual communion who
would never have dreamed of the subject but for the
persecution and slander that was publicly directed
against the "Rochester Knockers."</p>

<p>The records of these persecutions and slanders
abound with disgraceful and painful incidents which,
whilst being discreditable to the persons responsible
for their propagation redound with full credit to the
honour and integrity of the mediums selected by the
Spirit world to be the forerunners of a new dispensation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>And thus the fiery cross, carried by the hands of
unseen messengers, sped from point to point; the
beacon fires lighted by invisible hands gleamed on
every mountain top, and the low muffled sound of
the spirit-raps that first broke the slumbers of the
peaceful inhabitants of the humble tenement at
Hydesville, became the clarion peal that sounded out
to the millions of the Western Hemisphere, the anthem
of the soul's immortality, chorused by hosts of God's
bright ministering angels.</p>

<h2>A SEQUEL to the "ROCHESTER KNOCKINGS,"
after 56 years.</h2>

<div class='center'>"TRUTH CRUSHED TO EARTH WILL<br />

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p>Regardless of what the "Banner" knows of this
matter, we prefer to present the following statement
as given in the Boston Journal of Nov. 23. To
opponents of the claims made by Spiritualists, the
account may bear greater weight than if made by a
Spiritualist paper. Take note that the Journal says,
"an almost entire human skeleton," and not the bones
of a large dog or of any four-footed animal.</p>

<p>Rochester, N. Y., Nov. 22, 1904.&mdash;The skeleton of
the man supposed to have caused the rappings first
heard by the Fox sisters in 1848 has been found in
the walls of the house occupied by the sisters, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
clears them from the only shadow of doubt held
concerning their sincerity in the discovery of spirit
communication.</p>

<p>The Fox sisters declared they learned to communicate
with the spirit of a man, and that he told them
he had been murdered and buried in the cellar.
Repeated excavations failed to locate the body and
thus give proof positive of their story.</p>

<p>The discovery was made by school children playing
in the cellar of the building in Hydesville known as
the "Spook house," where the Fox sisters heard the
wonderful rappings. William H. Hyde, a reputable
citizen of Clyde, who owns the house, made an investigation
and found an almost entire human skeleton
between the earth and crumbling cellar walls, undoubtedly
that of the wandering pedlar whom it was
claimed was murdered in the east room of the house,
and whose body was hidden in the cellar.</p>

<p>Mr. Hyde has notified relatives of the Fox sisters
and the notice of the discovery will be sent to the
National Order of Spiritualists, many of whom remember
having made pilgrimages to the "Spook house,"
as it is commonly called. The finding of the bones
practically corroborates the sworn statement made by
Margaret Fox, April 11, 1848. The Fox sisters claimed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
to have been disturbed by rappings and finally by a
system of signals got into communication with the
spirit.</p>

<p>According to Margaret Fox's statement the spirit
was that of a pedlar, who described how he had been
murdered in the house, his body being buried in the
cellar. There were numerous witnesses to the rappings,
but although the cellar had been dug up many
times no traces of the body was found until the
crumbling cellar walls revealed the skeleton.</p>

<p>The name of the murdered man, according to his
revelation to the Fox sisters, was Charles Rosna, and
the murderer a man named Beck. In 1847 the house
was occupied by Michael Weekman, a poor laborer.
He and his family became troubled by these mysterious
rappings, which followed in succession at different
intervals, especially during the night. The family
became so broken by fear and loss of sleep that they
vacated the house. On Dec. 11, the Fox family
moved in and two months later the rappings were
resumed and the family became frightened. Finally
Margaret and Cathie grew bold and asked questions
which were answered, revealing the murder.</p>

<h2>FROM HYDESVILLE.</h2>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p>The "Sunflower," December, 1904, says: "The
following bit of information was transmitted hitherward,
which, if confirmed, will create additional
interest in Spiritualism, although, by no means confirming
the latter, as that does not rest exclusively
on the phenomena at Hydesville; for since then we
have had many additional phenomena, as the varied
physical phases, materialisation, slate-writing and
drawing, painting, levitation, passing of matter
through matter, trance-speaking, clairvoyance, psychometric
reading, and numerous other modes of communicating
with the spirit world. The correspondent
says: William H. Hyde, who recently found the arm
and leg bones of a human being at the old Fox
homestead, made another search in the cellar where
the bones were first exposed by the caving in of the
inside cellar wall. Mr. Hyde discovered all the other
important bones except the skull. The latter corroborates
the statement as made in the history of the
first rappings, a work entitled, 'The Missing Link in
Spiritualism.'"</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p>Note by Editor.&mdash;Attention is drawn to the fact
that a portion of the skull (which the foregoing report
declares to be missing) was discovered during the digging
operations at the time of the "Knockings"&mdash;1848.</p>
